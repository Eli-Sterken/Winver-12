Hello and welcome to Winver 12!

This program is an executable written in C# using the .NET framework. It is a new, updated version of the Windows "winver" program located in C:\Windows\System32.
If it ever comes, it is designed for Windows 12 (if it ever comes) and has a new logo and green theme. 

Unfortunately, I do not have the de-compiled version, as this was part of a project I was working on to make Windows 12,
but I stopped it because a new Windows update broke many of the things I had made for it. I have managed to find the compiled app, though.
I may make an installer for it at some point, but it is not my main focus right now.

Anyway, I hope you like it, and feel free to make contributions to it as well. (It is .net, so it would probably be fairly easy to de-compile.)

Have fun!
