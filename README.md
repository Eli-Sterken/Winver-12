Hello and welcome to Winver 12!

This program is an executable written in C# using the .NET framework. It is a new, updated version of the Windows "winver" program located in C:\Windows\System32.
It is designed for Windows 12 (if it ever comes) and has a new logo and green theme. 

This was origanaly part of a project I was working on to make Windows 12, but I stoped it due to a new Windows 
update breaking a lot of the programs I made for it. I have got here the Installer, and program for it though.
I hope you like it.

Have fun!
